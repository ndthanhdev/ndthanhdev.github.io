I recently started working with Databricks and wanted to set up a local development environment to make it easier to work with notebooks and version control. In this post, I'll take you through the steps to set up a local Databricks environment using VSCode and Mini Conda.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, you'll need to have the following tools:

- **Databricks workspace:** you can follow [this guide](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/index.html) to create get a trial workspace or use an existing one.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your machine.

## Step 1: Conenct to Databricks workspace

The first step is to connect your Databricks workspace to your local machine. You can do this by generating a token in your Databricks workspace and using it to connect to the workspace.

## Step 3: Install Mini Conda

Mini Conda is a lightweight version of Anaconda that allows you to create and manage python environments. It means you can have multiple python environments on your machine and switch between them easily.

Anaconda offers graphical installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux but I would recommend using installation scripts. [You can find the OS specific installation scripts here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install). At the time of writing, the installation script for **Linux** is as follows:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

And don't forget to initialize mini conda for your shell, for example, for zsh:

```bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
```

Now restart your shell and you should be able to use `conda` command. For example, I'm using zsh so I would run:

```bash
> zsh

> conda --version
conda 24.4.0
```

## Step 4: Prepare Python environment

Next we'll create a new conda environment named `dbr` for our Databricks project. Run the following command to create a new environment:

```bash
> conda create -n dbr
```

## Step 5: Run notebooks locally
