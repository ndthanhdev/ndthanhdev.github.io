title: How I added dagger.io

I wanted to have the ability to run CI/CD pipelines on my local, and I decided to go with [Dagger.io](https://dagger.io/). It not only fed my need and also added a lot of instresting features. In this post I'll share how I added dagger.io to my personal website.

## Requirements

My personal website is a static site generated using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I have some scripts that I run locally to lint, build and publish the site, they are located in `scripts` directory.

I'm hosting my website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using 3 environments: `development`, `staging` and `production`. These environments are hosted on:

- `Development`: [https://dev-n8v.github.io/](https://dev-n8v.github.io/)
- `Staging`: [https://stg-n8v.github.io/](https://stg-n8v.github.io/)
- `Production`: [https://ndthanhdev.github.io/](https://ndthanhdev.github.io/)

I want to apply "Trunk Based Development", so whenever I push a commit to `main` branch, the site should be published to `development`. Whenever a merge request is merged to `release-<version>` branch, the site should be published to `staging`. And when I create a release(a tag), the site should be published to `production`.
